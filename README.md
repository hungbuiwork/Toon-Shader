# Toon Shader
A toon-shader I've been developing that allows customizability of (color, size, smoothness, intensity) of (shadows, specular light, rim light). This customizability allows the user to blend between realistic/cartoony aesthetics. Currently does not support cast shadows, but I am working on it!
